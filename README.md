# SevenSeg_Multiplexed
Arduino library for use with Common Anode seven segment LED displays.

Howdy,

I have a few of these displays I'd like to use in future projects.
I also realized I that since I gained so much knowledge from websites
like GitHub, I should *beautify* my code and post it online for other
young players in the game to see well written code.
